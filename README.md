## About

I, a 6th-semester computer science student hailing from a Tier 3 city in India, embarked on a startup journey fueled by a passion for solving a pressing issue in our country's agriculture sector. The problem I observed was the extreme volatility in vegetable prices due to the disorganized nature of farming practices.

## Problem Statement

The vegetable price crisis was evident; for instance, tomatoes could be shockingly cheap at 2 rupees per kg in some months and exorbitantly expensive, reaching 150 rupees per kg, in others. This led to dire consequences: farmers faced significant losses during periods of low prices, and sadly, some even resorted to tragic suicides. On the flip side, consumers struggled to afford essential vegetables during price spikes.

The root cause of this price imbalance was the uncoordinated planting of vegetables. Too many farmers planted certain vegetables at the same time, leading to oversupply, plummeting prices, and farmer distress. Conversely, some vegetables were planted sparingly, resulting in high prices beyond the reach of consumers.

## Solution

Inspired by this glaring issue, I conceived the idea of "Asha" â€“ a mobile app designed to empower farmers with knowledge about when and how much to plant each month or season. By educating farmers on optimal planting quantities and schedules, Asha aims to balance vegetable prices, benefiting both farmers and consumers.

## Project Vision

Our primary goal is not profit-driven; it's about uplifting our country's farmers and ensuring that nutritious produce is accessible to all. We envision a future where Asha plays a pivotal role in achieving stability and prosperity in the agricultural community, ultimately contributing to food security.
